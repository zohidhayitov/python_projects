# Geocoding / Geomapping Flask App

## Brief description of the project
	An app that aims to provide different geomapping functionalities & geographic analyses, using either user input or data gathered through web scraping.

## Functionalities
	- transforming a dynamic number of user inputs, consisting of arbitrary names & valid addresses, into geographical coordinates that are displayed on a map with a hovering popup for each location
	- generates & displays a map of European capitals (data scraped from Wikipedia)
	- generates & displays a map of all countries, with annotations also containing capitals and GDP per capita (data scraped from Wikipedia & worlddata.info)
	- view scatterplot of latitude & GPD per capita, with plotted points sized proportionally to gdp; displayed correlation & p_value

## Future Developments
	- Generate & display geographical coordinates by address
	- Data Visualizations
	- Regression Analyses
